# Reactome Simulator - Cellular Management Game

A realistic cellular biology simulation game where you manage the complex molecular processes of a living cell. Guide your cell through metabolic pathways, energy production, waste management, and ultimately achieve cellular reproduction - all while facing the challenges that real cells encounter every day.

## üß¨ Game Features

### Core Cellular Processes

- **Metabolic Flexibility**: Switch between aerobic and anaerobic pathways based on conditions
- **Resource Management**: Each molecule has realistic capacities and consumption rates
- **Process Dependencies**: Complex biochemical pathways with realistic requirements

## üéÆ How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Survive**: Keep your cell alive by managing energy (ATP) and waste products
2. **Balance Resources**: Monitor glucose, oxygen, and other critical molecules
3. **Run Processes**: Click cellular process buttons to activate metabolic pathways
4. **Optimize Efficiency**: Build enzymes and organelles to improve process performance
5. **Grow and Divide**: Accumulate enough resources to achieve cell division

### Key Strategies
- **Energy Management**: Run glycolysis for quick ATP, respiration for efficient ATP
- **Waste Control**: Use waste removal and ensure CO‚ÇÇ doesn't accumulate
- **Growth Phase**: Build proteins and organelles to increase cellular capacity
- **Division Timing**: Carefully time cell division when you have sufficient resources

### Time Controls
- **Pause**: Space bar or ‚è∏ button
- **Speed Control**: 1-5x speed options for different gameplay paces
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 1=Normal, 2=Fast, 3=Slow, 4=Very Fast

## üìä Molecular Systems

### Essential Molecules
- **Glucose**: Primary energy source (critical < 5, target 10+)
- **Oxygen**: Required for efficient respiration (critical < 3, target 8+)  
- **ATP**: Cellular energy currency (critical < 5, target 15+)
- **Water**: Essential for all cellular processes
- **Waste**: Must be kept below 200 to avoid death

### Intermediate Molecules
- **Pyruvate**: Bridge between glycolysis and respiration
- **Amino Acids**: Building blocks for protein synthesis
- **Nucleotides**: Required for DNA/RNA synthesis
- **Lipids**: Membrane components and energy storage

### Advanced Molecules (Late Game)
- **Heat Shock Proteins**: Protection against temperature stress
- **Antioxidants**: Defense against oxidative damage
- **Damaged Proteins**: Accumulated cellular damage requiring cleanup
- **DNA Damage**: Genetic damage that needs repair

## üî¨ Biological Accuracy

### Real Cellular Processes
- **Glycolysis**: Converts 1 glucose ‚Üí 2 ATP + 2 pyruvate (anaerobic)
- **Cellular Respiration**: 2 pyruvate + 6 oxygen ‚Üí 28 ATP + 6 CO‚ÇÇ + 6 water
- **Fermentation**: Emergency anaerobic pathway producing waste
- **Protein Synthesis**: Amino acids + ATP + RNA ‚Üí Proteins
- **DNA Replication**: High-energy process requiring nucleotides and ATP

### Death Conditions
Based on real cellular biology:
- **Waste Toxicity**: Death when waste ‚â• 200 (cellular poisoning)
- **CO‚ÇÇ Poisoning**: Death when CO‚ÇÇ ‚â• 120 (respiratory acidosis)
- **Energy Depletion**: Death when ATP < 0 (cellular energy crisis)

### Metabolic Pathways
- **Aerobic Respiration**: Highly efficient but requires oxygen
- **Anaerobic Fermentation**: Less efficient but oxygen-independent
- **Metabolic Switching**: Cells automatically adapt to available resources
